## DriverPass Project Summary

DriverPass was the client. They wanted a system that helps students prepare for their driving test by offering online learning and practice tests, plus an easy way to schedule driving lessons. The system also supports staff who need to manage student information, lesson scheduling, and reporting.

## What I Did Particularly Well

I did well translating the client’s needs into clear system diagrams and a structured design. The diagrams show how users interact with the system and how the main scheduling and practice test features work together. I also focused on making the design easy to understand and consistent across the different diagrams.

## What I Would Revise and How I Would Improve It

If I could revise one part, I would expand the design details around scheduling and reporting. I would add more detail to the data relationships and clarify edge cases such as cancellations, rescheduling rules, and how staff overrides are handled. This would make the design even clearer for future development.

## How I Interpreted User Needs and Implemented Them

I focused on what students and staff would need to do most often. Students need simple account access, lesson scheduling, and practice tests with progress tracking. Staff need ways to support students, keep schedules accurate, and view reports. Considering user needs is important because the system has to be practical and easy to use. If the design is confusing or does not match real workflows, users will avoid it and the business will lose time fixing issues manually.

## My Approach to Designing Software

I start by identifying goals, users, and the key tasks the system must support. Then I break the work into models that show behavior and structure. In the future, I would continue using techniques like requirements lists, process modeling for key workflows, and object modeling for the data and roles in the system. I would also validate designs by walking through real scenarios to confirm the system supports what users actually need.
